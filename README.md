## Reflection

---

Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

_Required_

🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

    majority of the user stories requirement only the delete button has an issue so far but i attempted it.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

    Creating the delete button on posts that allows users to delete the post from the database. i tried making it work but still has an issue.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

    the client/server in next js differentiating them was a big problem for me.

_Optional_

🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

🎯 Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

    what approach is the best to handle deletion please.

🎯 What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
